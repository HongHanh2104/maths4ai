Homework 1: Image Compression using SVD
Name: Nguyen Le Hong Hanh
ID: 13005

Results:
* All code and comments are particularly shown in file NguyenLeHongHanh_SVD.ipynb.

* If you want to test with another image, you need to change the value of 'path' variable which stores the dir to that image. By default, I use the image '4.jpg' is stored in 'data' folder.

* In terms of this image (4.jpg), the value k = 250 is the best, in my opinion.
